title: Project setup
---

## Installing dependencies
The project requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

:::tip
If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on MacOS,
the easiest way to install them would be through
```sh
brew install node
brew install --cask docker
```
:::

We use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing Node packages.
Check that you have it with
```sh
yarn -v
```
If the command is invalid, install it with
```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

## Setting up project
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/csse-uoft/SNM-I
```

2. Install node dependencies in both the `frontend/` and `backend/` directories
```sh
cd SNM-I/frontend
yarn install
cd ../backend
yarn install
```

3. You should receive a `.env` file with the server credentials.
Place it inside of `backend/`.

4. Allow self-signed localhost certificates on your browser and restart the browser
  - **chrome**: enable `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost`
  - **firefox**: Go to Preferences â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ View certificates â†’
    Servers â†’ Add Exception â†’ add `localhost:5000`

5. Create the mongoDB and graphDB docker images.
To do this, you need to first start the docker daemon.
If you installed the docker desktop (eg. `brew install --cask docker`),
this might be done for you already. Open the docker app to start the daemon.

Alternatively, you can start it in the command line by running `dockerd` as root
or through your service manager:
```sh
sudo dockerd # keep this running, or
systemctl start docker # if you use systemd, or
sudo service docker start # if you use open-rc
```

Then create the docker images with the following commands:
```sh
docker create -p 127.0.0.1:7200:7200 --name graphdb --restart unless-stopped -t ontotext/graphdb:10.0.2 --GDB_HEAP_SIZE=6G -Dgraphdb.workbench.maxUploadSize=2097152000
docker create --name mongo -p 27017:27017 â€“â€“restart unless-stopped -d mongo:latest
```

:::note
The `graphdb` and `mongo` after `--name` are just for yourself to tell apart.
You can name them whatever you want!
:::

:::tip[For Apple M series users]
The performance of GraphDB might be faster on the
[ontotext client](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/graphdb-free/) instead of the docker image.
:::

## Running in production
### Backend
1. Start the docker daemon (see above).
2. Start the docker images, either through the desktop GUI or `sudo docker start graphdb mongo` (use the names from earlier).
The graphdb interface should start on port 7200.
3. Run `yarn start` in the `backend/` directory.
The server should start on port 8080.

### Frontend
1. Run `yarn start` in the `frontend/` directory.
The site should served at port 3000.
2. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and log in with the following credentials:

Field | Value
---|---
Email | admin@snmi.ca
Password | admin
What university is CSSE associated with? | UofT
What is CSSEâ€™s home department? | MIE
What is CSSEâ€™s purpose? | research

:::note
Make sure you log in every time you restart the frontend/backend even if you are seeing the dashboards.
If you are getting error 403, itâ€™s likely because you bypassed the login wall with your browser's cached pages and aren't actually authorized.
